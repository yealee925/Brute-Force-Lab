# Root Access Lab

## Objective
The Root Access Lab introduces the basics of hacking into a target Linux system (10.10.177.161). The hacking involved active reconnaissance to gather the information necessary to gain access to the user's files.

### Skills Learned
- Used nmap to see what ports were open in the target system
- 

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
1. Start the terminal and use nmap
